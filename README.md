# Practical Machine Learning Course Project
This work is in compliance to the assignment for the Practical Machine Learning course in Coursera.

This project is intended to predict the manner in which people did their exercise
using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

Additional information from the course website:

## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

## Project Files
This repository has the following project files:
1. [writeup.html](https://cpats.github.io/practicalml/writeup.html)- the compiled HTML file showing the analysis and codes used for data loading until the prediction process.
2. writeup.Rmd - the R markdown file which formats the analysis and codes used for data loading until the prediction process.
3. README.md - this is the file you are currently reading. This gives an overview of the project and codes used to manipulate the data set to come up with the required outputs.
